# dynamic-form

`dynamic-form` is my take on a json driven form component using `@angular/material`. It is a complete re-implementation from scratch, using the experience gained from a previous project that had similar requirements.

If this evolves into something worthwhile and different enough from other implementations, like e.g. [ngx-formly](https://github.com/ngx-formly/ngx-formly), I might make it available as an npm package in the future.
